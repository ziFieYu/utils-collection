Mutable Set
———--

A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements.

To implement a concrete mutable set, you need to provide implementations
of the following methods:

    def contains(elem: A): Boolean
    def iterator: Iterator[A]
    def += (elem: A): this.type
    def -= (elem: A): this.type

If you wish that methods like `take`,
`drop`, `filter` return the same kind of set,
you should also override:

    def empty: This

It is also good idea to override methods `foreach` and
`size` for efficiency.
